# GitHub Pages Assignment

> In this assignment, you'll create a simple, public website hosted on GitHub using HTML and CSS

## Your task

* Create a GitHub pages repository (must be named `YOUR_USERNAME.github.io`)
* Create an `index.html` file in the repository
* Add at least six kinds of HTML elements to `index.html` (`<h1>`, `<div>`, etc.)
* Add at least one image
* Give at least one of your HTML elements a `class` attribute
* Create a `styles.css` file
* Add a `style.css` to your HTML file by creating a `<link>` tag in your `index.html` file
* In `styles.css`, create at least three style rules that change how things look in `index.html`

## Stretch goals

* Add three more style rules to `style.css` that only apply to HTML elements when they are hovered over
* Use CSS to rotate one of your elements
* Use CSS to blur an image
